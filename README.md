lib-list holds list utilities such as cdr, reverse, remove, contains, etc.
lib-math holds functions dealing with scalars, vectors, and matrices, as well as the identity function and the standard basis vectors
lib-draw holds mostly things I've created, including rainbow, poly, loft, and sweep
lib imports lib-draw, lib-draw imports lib-math, lib-math imports lib-list
nothing imports lib-3d, and it will probably be retired shortly
tests are currently as-needed; since running a test involves visual inspection tests are tailored to the edits that require them
